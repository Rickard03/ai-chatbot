## How do I set it up? :heart:

1. Press on the green button that says "Clone or download" and download it as a .zip file. 
2. Extract the files somewhere on your computer. We recommend creating a folder called "steambot" on your desktop. 
3. Install NodeJS. NodeJS is the core of this bot. It's required for it to work. https://nodejs.org/en/
4. Install Desktop Authenticator, it's optional but if you want it to work automatically this step is REQUIRED: https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamDesktopAuthenticator
5. Find your shared secret & identity secret. [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjdOJVSZ9Mo)
6. Edit `config.json`. You have to set the shared secret & identity secret to the one you've got from step 5. 
7. Run `install.bat`
8. You're all set. You now have a Steam bot running on your Steam account! 


Type
```sh
npm install
```

Then run
```sh
npm nodemon server.js
```
